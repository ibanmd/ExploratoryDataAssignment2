# Exploratory Data Analysis Project 2
### August 2014

## For my graders...

### Plot 1
When emissions are measured in total for the year or by average value per observation, the values decrease through the years.  Note that the red line is in Millions of Tons, while the blue line is in Tons.

### Plot 2
This plot shows that both the total mass of emissions went down through the years, as well as the average mass of each observation.  Note that the blue line has values of Tons while the red line has values of Thousand Tons.

### Plot 3
This plot shows that all types of emissions decreased through the years except for "Point" which saw a spike around 2005 but decreased thereafter.  Note that the values are in Tons.

### Plot 4
This plot shows that both the total mass of emissions went down through the years, as well as the average mass of each observation.  Note that the blue line has values of Tons while the red line has values of Ten Thousand Tons.

### Plot 5
This plot shows that both the total mass of emissions went down through the years, as well as the average mass of each observation.  Note that the blue line has values of Pounds while the red line has values of Thousand Pounds.

### Plot 6
This plot shows that Los Angeles had increasing levels of emissions until 2005, until beginning to decrease again.  Baltimore emissions have been decreasing thoughout the time frame.  Note that both values are in Tons and that there are two different y-axis labels, one for each city.  The Los Angeles values are much larger than the Baltimore values.
